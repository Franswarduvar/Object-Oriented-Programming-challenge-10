# Object-Oriented-Programming-challenge-10

This project uses Object Oriented programing to create an HTML file filled with the info the user provides.

The main stupulations and challenges I found when doing this project was around the unit tests. I am submitting this challenge as is as I will revisit the unit tests once I get some feedbalk around my nect steps. I feel confdent around my code other then the unit tests and the bugs I found when try to get it to render to the page.

In the Lib folder you will find all information around the Manager,Intern,Engineer and the Employee. The Dist folder holds the final product filled with the information prodived by the user. Jest and Inquirer are the only two dependencies.
Thank you :)
